==========
Req:

Basic version
 - start a new project using http://yeoman.io and push it to a public repo on GitHub
 - save the attached JSON file in a "/teams" directory and load it
 - display the content of the "players" array in a grid using "thumbnailSrc", "number", "position", "age", "firstName" and "lastName" and a few key statistics
 - make it responsive, from iPhone to very-large-screens

Fancy version
 - setup a specific task to package a production build using grunt plugins (minify, CDN, concat)
 - make it look good :)
 - describe (and/or implement) other possible optimizations to speed up the page (DNS preftech, lazy loading, ...)
